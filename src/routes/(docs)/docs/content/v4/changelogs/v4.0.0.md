Kener v4.0.0 is a major release with architecture, API, and data-model changes. This release adds new platform capabilities (pages, recurring maintenance, customizable templates, improved subscriptions), and introduces several migration requirements for existing v3 deployments.

## Breaking changes {#breaking-changes}

### Redis is now required for full functionality {#redis-required}

Redis is now a core runtime dependency for queues/background workflows (alerts, scheduling, email fan-out, docs indexing updates, and related async operations).

If you are upgrading from v3, make sure `REDIS_URL` is configured in your environment.

### Heartbeat endpoint changed {#heartbeat-endpoint-changed}

Heartbeat monitor URL changed from v3 to v4:

- v3: `/api/heartbeat/{tag}:{secret}`
- v4: `/ext/heartbeat/{tag}:{secret}`

Both `GET` and `POST` remain supported, but old integrations must update the path.

### Subscription system redesigned {#subscriptions-redesigned}

The subscription model and storage were redesigned in v4.

Deprecated tables:

- `subscription_triggers`
- `subscriptions`
- `subscribers`

The `invitations` table is also deprecated as part of the v4 redesign and user-flow updates.

### API contract changed (v3 → v4) {#api-contract-changed}

Comparing `static/api-references/v3.json` and `static/api-references/v4.json`:

- **36 endpoints/methods added**
- **16 endpoints/methods removed**

Notable direction of change:

- New resource namespaces under `/api/v4/*`
- Added first-class resources for:
    - `incidents` + incident comments
    - `maintenances` + maintenance events
    - `monitors` + monitoring data edits
    - `pages`
    - `site` config keys
- Legacy v3 routes such as `/api/incident/*`, `/api/monitor*`, `/api/status` were replaced by v4 resource-oriented routes.

## Data model and migration notes {#data-model-and-migration-notes}

### New page model and subpath support {#pages-and-subpath-support}

v4 introduces page-scoped status views and monitor mapping:

- `pages`
- `pages_monitors`

You can now publish multiple status pages/subpaths from one instance and control monitor visibility per page.

### Categories and monitor ordering moved to pages {#categories-and-monitor-ordering}

In v4, monitor grouping/display should be managed through **Pages**.

- Add monitors to a page and they will be shown in that page order.
- The monitor order on a page is the order users see on the status page.

### Recurring maintenance scheduling {#recurring-maintenance-scheduling}

v4 adds RRULE-based maintenance scheduling with dedicated tables:

- `maintenances`
- `maintenance_monitors`
- `maintenances_events`

This enables one-time and recurring maintenance windows with generated event instances.

### Monitor maintenance impact and status override {#monitor-maintenance-impact}

Maintenance now supports per-monitor impact/status behavior (for example `MAINTENANCE` override while events are ongoing), improving incident communication during planned work.

### Monitoring data enhancements {#monitoring-data-enhancements}

Monitoring data now includes richer operational context, including support for `error_message` fields and improved data inspection/update workflows in v4 APIs and dashboard tooling.

## New and improved capabilities {#new-and-improved-capabilities}

### User subscriptions and admin workflows {#subscriptions-and-admin-workflows}

- Subscription UX has been redesigned
- Better incidents/maintenances preference flows
- Admin can add/manage subscribers directly from dashboard
- Subscription notifications now align with v4 incident and maintenance lifecycle events

### Customizable email templates {#customizable-email-templates}

Built-in email templates can now be managed and customized from the dashboard (**Manage → Templates**), including subscription-related templates.

### Announcement banner {#announcement-banner}

v4 supports site-wide announcement banners with richer controls (message, type, dismiss behavior, optional CTA).

### Embed and event visibility improvements {#embed-and-events-improvements}

- Live events embed experiences were expanded
- Better event surfacing for ongoing incidents/maintenances
- Improved sharing/embedding workflows for status communications

### Uptime calculation flexibility {#uptime-calculation-flexibility}

Uptime behavior is more configurable in v4, including formula-level flexibility and maintenance-aware behavior.

### Rendering and dashboard UX upgrades {#rendering-and-dashboard-upgrades}

v4 includes broader frontend/runtime improvements, including more client-driven data interactions for monitor and operational views, with improved responsiveness and control.

## Upgrade checklist from v3 {#upgrade-checklist-from-v3}

Before promoting v4 to production:

1. Configure Redis (`REDIS_URL`).
2. Update all heartbeat callers to `/ext/heartbeat/{tag}:{secret}`.
3. Revalidate subscription data/flows against the new v4 system.
4. Audit integrations/scripts for removed v3 API routes.
5. Regenerate or re-import API clients from `static/api-references/v4.json`.
6. Validate custom domain + `ORIGIN` and auth form behavior in production.
7. If you used v3 categories, migrate display organization to v4 pages and verify monitor order per page.
