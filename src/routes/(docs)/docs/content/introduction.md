### MIT License {#mit-license}

Kener is licensed under the MIT License, a permissive open-source license that allows you to use, modify, and distribute the software freely. This means you can customize Kener to fit your specific needs without worrying about legal restrictions. Whether you're a small startup or a large enterprise, Kener's MIT License gives you the freedom to innovate and adapt as your business grows.

### Modern Design {#modern-design}

### Powerful Monitoring {#powerful-monitoring}

Set up custom triggers based on monitor status changes to ensure the right people are notified at the right time.
